# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributions. A simple workflow:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Run the tests locally: create a venv and run `bash ./scripts/continue_and_run.sh` (this will install deps and run the smoke test).
3. Open a pull request describing your change and link relevant issues.
4. Keep PRs small and focused. Add tests for new behavior where possible.

If you want help picking tasks, open an issue and tag it `help wanted`.
